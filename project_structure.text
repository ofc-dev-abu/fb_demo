//<-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



ROLE
You are a world-class Frontend Architect and production React engineer with deep experience producing pixel-perfect website clones, advanced animations, and developer-ready projects.

GOAL
Create a pixel-perfect, end-to-end frontend clone of Touras using:
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- animejs for timeline/scroll/sequence animations
- react-router-dom for routing
- Swiper.js (or equivalent) for carousels

You will clone every page/path I list below **exactly** (visual layout, spacing, animations, interactions, and responsiveness). Use placeholder images (Unsplash) for assets unless I upload originals. Do NOT include copyrighted assets from the original site.

IMPORTANT: I have attached three reference images (navbar, dropdown, footer). Use those images to match exact navbar/dropdown/footer visuals. If Bolt/Claude cannot see attachments yet, ask me to upload them.

Images for reference : 

1st attached image for - Navbar Reference 

2nd attached image for - Navbar dropdown

3rd attached image for - Footer

REQUIREMENTS & DELIVERABLES (must produce all)
1. A runnable Vite project that starts with:
   npm install
   npm run dev
2. Full implementation of every page/route listed below, wired to react-router-dom.
3. All pages use Tailwind and animejs for animations/scroll reveals.
4. All dynamic content comes from JSON files under src/data/ (products.json, industries.json, blog.json, resources.json).
5. Accessibility: keyboard-accessible dropdowns, ARIA attributes, alt text, reduced-motion respect.
6. Performance: lazy-load images, debounce scroll handlers, avoid jank.
7. Basic Jest + React Testing Library smoke tests for Home, one Product (Neux), and Blog routes.
8. README.md with setup, run, build, deploy notes, and instructions to replace placeholder assets.
9. scripts/zip.js (or shell script) to create /mnt/data/touras-clone.zip package of the full project.
10. Provide the ZIP at /mnt/data/touras-clone.zip when finished.
11. CHANGELOG.md summarizing implemented pages and any visual ambiguities.
12. Provide clear list of placeholder asset filenames that must be replaced to match production visuals.

TECH & STYLE
- Use React + Vite + Tailwind + animejs
- Use Swiper.js for carousels
- Use Google Fonts to match site fonts (specify which fonts used)
- Mobile-first responsive design; provide breakpoints and CSS tokens in tailwind.config.js
- Use IntersectionObserver + animejs for in-view scroll reveals and staggered animations
- Dropdowns open on hover (desktop) and on click/tap (mobile), and close on Esc

NAVBAR & FOOTER
- Navbar must include top-level links: **Products, Industries, Blog, Resources** (exact text and order).
- Use attached navbar/dropdown/footer images to match style, spacing and hover/dropdown behaviour.
- Navbar and footer are shared across all pages and must match reference visuals closely.

INTERACTIONS & ANIMATIONS (must be replicated)
- Hero text reveal animations (staggered) using animejs timelines.
- Section in-view reveals with stagger (title → subtitle → content).
- Auto-marquee / auto-scroll areas (pause on hover).
- Smooth hover transitions on buttons, cards, links (scale + shadow + color fade).
- Carousels: autoplay, pause on hover, nav indicators.
- Sticky navbar with smooth show/hide and background transition.
- Dropdowns: fade + slide + subtle scale.
- Smooth anchor scrolling and scroll-to-top button.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

DESIGN & THEME
- Tailwind theme tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) declared in tailwind.config.js – match site’s visual tone (provide hex guesses if necessary).
- Provide CSS utilities for repeated micro-interactions (shadow, transition, focus).
- Mobile-first layout with breakpoints for tablet and desktop.

DATA
- src/data/products.json
- src/data/industries.json
- src/data/blog.json
- src/data/resources.json
All pages read content from these JSON files.

PROJECT FILES & STRUCTURE (required)
- package.json
- vite.config.js
- tailwind.config.js
- postcss.config.js
- public/
- src/
  - main.jsx
  - index.css
  - assets/
  - components/ (Header, Footer, Hero, Marquee, Carousel, ProductCard, BlogCard, Tabs, Dropdown, etc.)
  - pages/ (Home.jsx, products/Neux.jsx, products/Apix.jsx, products/Payouts.jsx, industries/*, blog/Blog.jsx, blog/BlogDetail.jsx, resources/*)
  - data/
  - hooks/ (useInView, useMarquee, usePrefersReducedMotion)
  - utils/
  - tests/ (jest + react testing library)

TESTS
- Jest + React Testing Library smoke tests for:
  - Home route renders hero
  - /products/neux renders main product hero/section
  - /blog renders list and at least one blog detail route

OUTPUT SEQUENCE (what I expect from the Claude agent)
1) Initial analysis: component inventory for HOME, estimated color hex values, font guesses, animation plan, and list of ambiguous visuals that need my confirmation (short).
2) Provide package.json, vite.config.js, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js.
3) Provide project files file-by-file in code blocks, starting with src/main.jsx and index.css, then components, pages, data JSON, tests.
4) Provide README.md with run/build/deploy instructions and list of placeholder assets and filenames.
5) Provide scripts/zip.js or shell script and create /mnt/data/touras-clone.zip and return a download link.
6) Final QA checklist and short notes on how to replace placeholders to match production images.

AMBIGUITIES & ASKS
- If any exact pixel detail or image asset is ambiguous, choose the closest match and list it in the initial analysis.
- If you need the three reference images (navbar, dropdown, footer) and they are not visible, request that I upload them now.

Important rules
- Do not use copyrighted images from the original site.
- All code must be runnable — no pseudo-code.
- Keep the output modular and well-documented.

Start now. First output the **Initial analysis** (component inventory for HOME page, color hex guesses, font guesses, animation plan, and any ambiguous items asking for confirmation). Then provide package.json and config files.
